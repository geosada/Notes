title: "Introduction of Tukey Median"
---
In 1-dimension, the median is more robust against the presence of outliers than the mean.
A generalization of the 1-dimensional median to high dimensions is known as Tukey median;
intuitively, it is a point that is a median in every projection.
We will see the robustness of Tukey median in this post.
This post is based on [the course note](https://jerryzli.github.io/robust-ml-fall19/lec3.pdf) by Jerry Li,
and the italics in this post are quoted from the note.

## $\epsilon$-corruption model
The problem we will tackle is called $\epsilon$-corruption model:
    *Given samples from a distribution $D$, where an $\epsilon$-fraction have been corrupted,
when can we recover
statistics (e.g. mean, covariance) of $D$?*
Specifically, let $\epsilon \lt 1/2$ and $S = S_{g} \setminus S_{r} \cup S_{b}$ 
where $g$,$r$, and $b$ denote *good*, *replaced*, and *bad*, respectively.

Let $|S| = n$, $|S_{r}| = |S_{b}| = n \epsilon $, and $S_{g}$ is a set of i.i.d. samples from $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \text{I}\_{d})$.
What we can observe is $S$, and we assume that we know the value of $\epsilon$. 
We will estimate $\mu$ in this situation; in other words, we will output $\hat{\mu}$ that minimizes $\lVert \mu - \hat{ \mu} \rVert$.


## Tukey depth
We first introduce  *Tukey depth*.
For any set of points  $S \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}$ of size $n$, and any point $\eta \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$,
Tukey depth is defined as
\\[
    \text{depth}(S, \eta) = \inf_{\lVert v \rVert_{2} =1}
    \frac{1}{n} | \\{ x \in S: \langle x - \eta, v \rangle \geq 0  \\} |.
\\]

The following figure illustrates for $n=15$.

![Tukey depth]({{site.baseurl}}/img/Tukey/fig_tukey_depth.png){: .centered width="500" }

In this example, $\text{depth}(S, \eta_{1})=\frac{6}{15}$ and $\text{depth}(S, \eta_{2})=\frac{0}{15}$,
and the half-spaces in yellow correspond to $x \in S$ for each.
For a given point $\eta$, $\text{depth}(S, \eta)$ is the minimum number of points that lie in the yellow region
while spinning the boundary line perpendicular to $v$ that passes through $\eta$.
*The larger the depth of $\eta$, the more central
the point is with respect to the dataset $S$*.

## Tukey median
The Tukey median, which we will denote $\text{Tukey}(S)$, is simply defined as 
\\[
    \text{Tukey}(S) = \underset{\eta}{\operatorname{argmax}} \text{depth}(S, \eta).
\\]
*Observe that this is fundamentally a property of projections of the data. Thus this can hope to circumvent
these dimensionality issues.*


## Robustness of Tukey median
We show that Tukey median can robustly estimate the true mean, i.e., the mean of the distribution before outliers,
or corrupted samples, contaminated it.
A situation where an $\epsilon$-fraction of samples from true distribution have been corrupted is called $\epsilon$-corruption.
Let $S \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}$ be an $\epsilon$-corrupted set of samples of size $n$ from $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \text{I}\_{d})$,
where $\epsilon \lt \frac{1}{6}$.
Then, there exists some universal constant $C \lt 0$ so that with probability $1 âˆ’ \delta$, we have that
\\[
    \lVert \text{Tukey}(S) - \mu \rVert_{2} \leq \Phi^{-1}
    \left (
    \frac{1}{2} + 3 \epsilon + 
    C \sqrt{ \frac{d + \log 1/\delta}{n} }
    \right ).
\\]
The proof will follow in the next post, but before that, if this form is true, then we can say the following:
if $n$ is sufficiently large and $\epsilon$ is relatively small, 
then the upper bound of the error between $\text{Tukey}(S)$ and $\mu$, i.e., the RHS, becomes $O(\epsilon)$.
It is because under such a condition, the RHS  $ \simeq \Phi^{-1} (\frac{1}{2} + 3 \epsilon)$, 
and $\Phi^{-1}(x)$ behaves almost linear around $x=\frac{1}{2}$, as

We derive the above in the next post.
